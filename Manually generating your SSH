# To generate SSH keys in macOS, follow these steps:
#

# This starts the key generation process. When you execute this command, the ssh-keygen utility prompts you to indicate where to store the key.
#
# Press the ENTER key to accept the default location. The ssh-keygen utility prompts you for a passphrase.
#
# Type in a passphrase. You can also hit the ENTER key to accept the default (no passphrase). However, this is not recommended.

# Your private key is saved to the id_rsa file in the .ssh directory and is used to verify the public key you use belongs to the same server.
#
#
# Your public key is saved to the id_rsa.pub; file and is the key you upload to your server. You can save this key to the clipboard by running this:
==> pbcopy < ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
#
# files location: 
# (local computer) ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub - copy inside key
# (server) ~/.ssh/authorized_key -- inser key of id_rsa.pub
